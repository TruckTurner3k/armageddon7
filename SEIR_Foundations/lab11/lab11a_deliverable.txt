Lab 11A deliverables (same style as Lab 1A but serverless)

Students must produce:

        1) RDS MySQL instance (in Default VPC)
            PubliclyAccessible = false
        
        2) DB subnet placement
            in private subnets if available (Default VPC often has public subnets; we’ll control access via SG regardless)
        
        3) Security groups
            RDS SG allows 3306 only from Lambda SG
        
        4) Secrets Manager secret
            JSON fields: username, password, host, port, dbname
        
        5) Lambda function (Python)
            attached to VPC subnets + Lambda SG
            environment variables set
        
        6) API Gateway
            POST /intake integration to Lambda
        
        7) Database table
            audit_events created
        
        8) Proof artifacts
            CLI outputs + a successful curl that inserts a row
